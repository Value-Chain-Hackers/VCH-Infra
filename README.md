# VCH Lab ‚Äì Practical Research Workflow from a Researcher's Perspective

## 1. Identify and Frame the Research Problem
- Observe a real-world issue or system breakdown
- Engage with stakeholders to understand needs and context
- Co-define the challenge with partners or beneficiaries
- Translate into a researchable problem statement
- Justify societal, economic, and environmental relevance

## 2. Contextualize with Literature and Practice
- Conduct a structured literature review
- Map relevant theories, legal frameworks, and policies (e.g. CSRD, EUDR)
- Analyze prior case studies or institutional reports
- Gather insights from practitioners, interviews, or workshops
- Identify conceptual gaps, contradictions, or innovations

## 3. Define Objectives and Research Questions
- Formulate guiding questions or hypotheses
- Define target outcomes (policy impact, practical tool, insight generation)
- Align research aims with stakeholder goals
- Establish success criteria and indicators

## 4. Design Methodology and Engagement Plan
- Choose suitable methods (surveys, interviews, modeling, desk research)
- Develop research instruments (guides, templates, frameworks)
- Co-create data collection protocols with field partners
- Define sampling logic and inclusion criteria
- Plan stakeholder check-ins and validation moments
- Prepare consent forms, ethical notes, and GDPR-safe workflows

## 5. Set Up Research Infrastructure
- Select tools for writing, collaboration, storage, and versioning
- Organize project folders, permissions, and document templates
- Configure data entry systems (Nextcloud forms, GitHub repos)
- Ensure reproducibility and traceability setup

## 6. Collect Data and Engage Stakeholders
- Conduct interviews, surveys, or workshops with field actors
- Log observational notes, transcripts, recordings
- Collect documents, reports, and digital sources
- Maintain communication with stakeholders throughout data collection
- Document engagement context and reflections

## 7. Process and Curate Data
- Clean and organize raw datasets
- Code qualitative transcripts
- Create summaries, fact sheets, or tagged excerpts
- Add metadata, version tags, and licensing info
- Store securely with backup and access protocols

## 8. Analyze Data and Generate Insights
- Conduct analysis (statistical, comparative, thematic, network)
- Use appropriate tooling (Excel, R, Python, qualitative coding tools)
- Involve stakeholders in interpreting preliminary results
- Explore alternative explanations or emerging patterns

## 9. Interpret, Validate, and Synthesize
- Link results back to theory, frameworks, and stakeholder needs
- Validate with advisory groups or co-researchers
- Draft conclusions, assumptions, and scenario options
- Co-reflect on meaning and future implications

## 10. Communicate and Disseminate
- Write reports, briefs, and recommendations
- Produce infographics, dashboards, or decision guides
- Present to partners, institutions, or conferences
- Publish findings on GitHub, institutional sites, or public channels
- Share back with all engaged actors (e.g. via Nextcloud or live session)

## 11. Reflect, Archive, and Prepare for Reuse
- Archive all data, documents, and versions clearly
- Document what worked and what didn‚Äôt (research diary, post-mortem)
- Identify questions for follow-up or continuation
- Ensure datasets and methods are licensed for future access
- Close the loop with stakeholders (e.g. feedback on implementation, impact)

## **Problem Definition**

### **Problem Statement:**
Many academic and research organizations, especially in supply chain finance, face significant challenges in integrating the right tools for data analysis, workflow automation, team collaboration, and AI-based experimentation. The lack of an integrated, open-source ecosystem leads to inefficiencies, increased setup times, higher costs, and difficulties in maintaining and scaling research infrastructures.

### **Specific Challenges:**
1. **Fragmented Toolsets**:
   - Academic institutions often rely on disparate tools for various functions (e.g., JupyterHub for notebooks, Neo4j for graph databases, n8n for automation). Integrating them manually leads to inefficiencies, inconsistent user experiences, and compatibility issues.
  
2. **High Licensing Costs**:
   - Many premium tools (e.g., MATLAB, Tableau) come with substantial licensing fees that strain research budgets, especially in institutions with limited funding for software.

3. **Collaboration and Communication**:
   - Research teams, especially in collaborative academic environments, struggle with real-time communication, project management, and data sharing due to lack of cohesive infrastructure and tools.

4. **Scalability and Sustainability**:
   - Existing research infrastructures often lack flexibility for scaling, with many legacy tools failing to provide automated updates or easy scaling options as research demands grow.

### **Goal of VCH-Infra**:
The goal is to provide an integrated, open-source ecosystem that streamlines collaboration, reduces setup times, minimizes licensing costs, and empowers students and researchers to tackle complex supply chain finance problems more efficiently.

## **Risk Analysis**

### **Risk Categories**

1. **Technological Risks:**
   - **Compatibility Issues**: Integrating diverse open-source tools can result in compatibility challenges, especially when updating or maintaining tools.
     - *Mitigation*: Ensure that all tools are Dockerized and tested for compatibility. Use container orchestration tools like Docker Compose to simplify integration.
  
   - **Performance and Scalability**: As the ecosystem grows with more users, there may be performance bottlenecks (e.g., server overload, slow response times).
     - *Mitigation*: Regularly monitor performance using Prometheus and Grafana to track server health, and scale infrastructure as needed (e.g., load balancing, additional server resources).

2. **Financial Risks:**
   - **Budget Overruns**: Open-source tools are free, but setting up and maintaining a server infrastructure (e.g., hosting costs, data storage, backups) could lead to unplanned expenses.
     - *Mitigation*: Plan budgets around open-source infrastructure, focusing on cost-effective tools (e.g., utilizing Nextcloud for file sharing and backups, which are more affordable than proprietary alternatives).

   - **Lack of Funding for Scaling**: Research institutions may face budget cuts or limited funding for expanding the ecosystem as the user base grows.
     - *Mitigation*: Build the infrastructure with scalability in mind, leveraging cloud services with cost-efficiency and applying for open-source project grants or partnerships.

3. **Operational Risks:**
   - **Complexity in Training**: Users might struggle with complex tools, especially when the setup is unfamiliar, leading to slow adoption and possible misuse.
     - *Mitigation*: Provide comprehensive training materials, detailed documentation, and community support. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and develop easy-to-follow tutorials for common tasks.

   - **Dependence on Open-Source Communities**: The long-term viability of the project depends on the continued development of open-source tools, which could become unsupported or abandoned.
     - *Mitigation*: Regularly assess and update the ecosystem, contributing to the communities behind the tools to ensure their continued development and support.

4. **Security and Data Privacy Risks:**
   - **Data Security**: Storing sensitive research data in an open-source infrastructure could expose vulnerabilities to data breaches or unauthorized access.
     - *Mitigation*: Implement strong encryption (e.g., using BorgBackup for secure backups), use access control policies for Nextcloud, and regularly audit systems for vulnerabilities.

   - **Compliance with Regulations**: Managing data in compliance with GDPR or other local laws (especially in academic settings) can be challenging.
     - *Mitigation*: Ensure that all tools, especially file-sharing and storage tools like Nextcloud, adhere to GDPR and data protection regulations. Implement strict access controls and audit trails.

5. **Adoption and Stakeholder Risks:**
   - **Resistance to Change**: Researchers and students may be hesitant to adopt a new infrastructure, preferring traditional, familiar tools.
     - *Mitigation*: Foster engagement by showcasing successful case studies, offering hands-on demonstrations, and encouraging feedback to improve the user experience.

   - **Lack of Collaboration**: Without proper adoption across academic departments, the ecosystem might fail to deliver its full potential in promoting collaboration.
     - *Mitigation*: Create incentives for early adopters, offer collaboration-specific features in tools like Mattermost and Work Adventure, and involve department heads in the planning and rollout process.
